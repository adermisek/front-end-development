                    March 1935),</strong> also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical
                chemist.

                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
                long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals
                along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").

                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915,
                which later became NASA.
